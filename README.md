# Random Quote Generator 
## The random quote generator will display a new quote on the page after the button is clicked

### Features I added:
* The quotes array that stores quote objects with properties about each quote
* The getRandomQuote function returns a random quote from the quotes array
* The getRandomColor function returns an array of three random numbers which correlates to red, green, and blue values
* The printQuote function returns the html to display the quotes on the webpage

### Instructions:
* Open the index.html file in Google Chrome
* Click the *Show another quote* button
* After the button is clicked, the quote on the page will change as well as the background color
* Each quote displays the author of the quote as well as the citation
* If the quote has a year or a season property, the webpage will display it underneath the quote
